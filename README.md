# FSW Comprehensive Technical Assessment

Building a whole working app from scratch!

## Introduction

For this project you'll build an entire web application and deploy it online. This project will go on your portfolio, so you want to spend the time to make it look good as well as function fully.

## Overview

Choose a site from the following list and build a copy of it. Try to think about how the site works, what database tables you'll need, and how the responsive layout shows and hides content.

* Twitter
* Yelp
* Reddit
* Facebook
* Instagram

Obviously you won't be building exact copies of these sites. Think about what your MVP is - for example, on twitter you'll definitely need user authentication, a form to write tweets, a homepage that shows everyone's tweets, and a profile page that shows only the user's tweets. For Yelp, you'll want user authentication, a page showing a list of businesses, a detail page for each business, and a way to add new places and leave comments on existing ones. Basically, explore the sites and think about what the **core features** are. 

If you have a different site in mind, run it by your instructor first.

You do not need to copy the exact styles of a site - you can use them for inspiration, like changing the color scheme. But the layout of your site should be pretty close to what you're copying.

## Deliverables

* A working, full-stack web application, deployed on the internet
* Documentation describing the project and how to set it up / run it

## Technical Requirements

1. Your site must use react, firebase, express, and sql. Redux is suggested. Any external libraries are allowed as well if you need them.
1. Your site must be deployed online. Heroku and netlify are ideal.
1. Authentication is required. Any of the above sites wouldn't make sense without authentication anyway.
1. Your project must be documented. See [Writing good readmes](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web/blob/master/projects/WritingGoodReadmes.md) for a great overview of what should be included in your project readme.

## Submission Guidelines

- Create a new issue on this repository with links to your projects. Make the title of the issue your full name. In the comment include:
  - A link to the code repository/repositories
  - A link to the live site (frontend and API if you built them separately)
